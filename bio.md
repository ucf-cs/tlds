# The Research Group

The Computer Software Engineering - Scalable and Secure Systems (CSE - S3) Lab at the University of Central Florida was established by Dr. Damian Dechev in 2010. His work focuses on concurrency and multithreading using C++. Dr. Dechev completed his Ph.D. degree in 2009 at Texas A&M University under the supervision of Dr. Bjarne Stroustrup. The CSE-S3 lab has been supported by the National Science Foundation, Sandia National Laboratories, and the Department of Energy.
